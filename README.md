# Emoji_predictor
Project Overview
This project is an AI/ML-based Emoji Predictor that suggests the most relevant emoji based on a given sentence or phrase. It's designed to mimic how messaging apps and keyboards automatically recommend emojis as you type, enhancing user expression and sentiment understanding.

🎯 Features
🔍 Predict the best-matching emoji for any text input

🤗 Supports both traditional ML and transformer-based models

🧠 Trained on real-world text (e.g., tweets or messages) with emojis

🌐 Option to deploy as a web app or API

🗃️ Dataset
We use a dataset containing sentences paired with corresponding emojis. You can:

Use pre-labeled data from sources like:

Kaggle Emoji Prediction

Twitter data using Tweepy + emoji filters

Example:

Text	Emoji
"I am so happy!"	😀
"I love pizza"	🍕
"Feeling sick today"	🤒

🛠️ Technologies Used
Type	Tool / Library
Programming	Python 3.8+
ML Libraries	scikit-learn, pandas
DL Libraries	TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
NLP	NLTK / Hugging Face (BERT)
Deployment	Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit

⚙️ How It Works
Text Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, lowercasing

Feature Extraction: Using CountVectorizer / TF-IDF / BERT embeddings

Model Training: ML (Logistic Regression, SVM) or DL (LSTM, BERT)

Prediction: Classifies input into emoji categories

Output: Returns most probable emoji
